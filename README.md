# WWM Overlay – MIDI Music Player

A beautiful, feature-rich MIDI music player for **Where Winds Meet** that plays your songs by automatically pressing the correct keyboard keys in-game.

> ⚠️ **WARNING: Use at Your Own Risk**
> The publisher has started banning players for using third-party tools (a broad category that includes many types of programs). It is unclear whether MIDI players specifically trigger bans, but the risk exists. Chinese server players have not yet reported any bans for using MIDI players. Proceed with caution.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts (Global Hotkeys)

These work even when the game has focus:

| Key            | Action                |
|--------------:|-----------------------|
| **ScrollLock** | Play / Pause          |
| **F10**        | Previous track        |
| **F11**        | Next track            |
| **F12**        | Stop                  |
| **End**        | Stop (alternative)    |
| **`[`**        | Previous note mode    |
| **`]`**        | Next note mode        |
| **Insert**     | Toggle mini mode      |

---

## 🎼 Note Calculation Modes

The app offers **9 algorithms** for mapping MIDI notes to in-game keys:

| Mode              | Description                                                    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **YueLyn**        | Recommended mode – YueLyn’s favorite all-round play mode      |
| **Closest**       | Finds the nearest available note (works well for most songs)  |
| **Wide**          | Uses higher & lower rows more often (wider spread)            |
| **Sharps**        | 36-key mode: prefers Shift/Ctrl sharps and flats              |
| **Quantize**      | Snaps to strict scale notes                                   |
| **Transpose Only**| Direct mapping with only octave shifting                      |
| **Pentatonic**    | 5-note pentatonic scale (do–re–mi–so–la)                      |
| **Chromatic**     | 12-semitone → 7-key detailed mapping                          |
| **Raw**           | Raw 1:1 mapping (`MIDI note % 21`), no extra processing       |

Change modes in real time via **`[` / `]`** or the **mode selector** in the bottom bar.

---

### 🎹 Key Modes (21 vs 36 Keys)

| Mode        | Description                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **21 Keys** | Natural notes only (default, simpler & safer)           |
| **36 Keys** | Adds sharps/flats with **Shift/Ctrl** modifier combos   |

Toggle via the **“21 / 36”** button in the bottom bar.

In **36-key mode**, sharps/flats send key combos like `Shift+X` or `Ctrl+X` **instantly**.  
If notes are missing, increase the **modifier delay** in Settings.

---

## ☁️ Cloud Gaming Mode

Designed for **GeForce Now**, **Xbox Cloud Gaming**, and similar services.

| Mode            | How it works                     | Background play |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Local**       | `PostMessage` to game window     | ✅ Yes          |
| **Cloud Gaming**| `SendInput` (global keyboard)    | ❌ No           |

⚠️ **Cloud Gaming Mode warnings:**

- Uses **SendInput** → sends real global keystrokes
- You **must** keep the cloud gaming window **focused**
- Don’t type in chat or other apps while playing
- **Background playback is not possible** in this mode

---

## 🎵 Band Mode (Experimental)

> ⚠️ **Experimental & unstable.**  
> Tested mainly on **local networks**. Expect bugs.

Play together with friends by splitting notes or tracks between multiple players.

### How it Works

1. One player creates a room (host)
2. Host shares the **6-character room code**
3. Friends join using the code
4. Host picks a song (auto-transfers to players who don't have it)
5. Each member clicks **Ready**
6. Host clicks **Play** for synchronized playback

### Play Modes

| Mode           | Description                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Split Notes**| Notes distributed round-robin among players          |
| **By Track**   | Each player picks a MIDI track (e.g. melody, bass)   |

### Sync & Calibration

- Host can adjust sync delay from **-2s to +5s**
- **Test** mode: plays test notes to all members
- If others sound **ahead** of you → decrease delay  
- If others sound **behind** you → increase delay

### Relay Server (TURN)

- For strict NAT / firewalled networks:
  - Enable **Relay Server** before creating/joining
- Helps P2P connections succeed where direct connections fail

## 💡 Tips

- **Finding MIDI files**:  
  Search `"song name midi"` or `"song name .mid"` online.
- **Bulk import**:  
  Use the **Import** button to load entire folders or ZIPs.
- **Song sounds wrong?**  
  - Try different **note modes** (`[` / `]`)
  - Adjust **octave shift** (+/-)
- **Too high / too low?**  
  Octave shift can fix pitch.
- **Continuous playback**:  
  Add multiple songs to the queue.
- **Quick access**:  
  Use the **search box** and **sort options**.
- **Mini mode**:  
  Press **Insert** to hide the full UI while playing.
- **Track selector**:  
  Use it to play only melody/lead instruments from a MIDI.

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Keys not registering in-game

- Make sure **Where Winds Meet** is running
- Game window must be **open** (can be in background, not minimized)
- You must be inside the **music minigame**

### Hotkeys not working

- Some keys may be used by other apps
- Browsers use **F12** for dev tools → try **End** instead
- Make sure the app is actually running (check system tray)

### Music sounds wrong

- The game only supports **21 keys (3 octaves)** – complex songs may be imperfect
- Try other **note modes**
- Use **octave shift** to move the song into a better range
- Try different MIDI versions of the song

### Songs not showing up

- `.mid` extension is required
- Files must be in the configured **album** folder
- Click **Refresh** in the sidebar to reload

### Progress bar jumps

- Can happen if multiple playback sources conflict
- Try **Stop → Play** again

## 📂 Where to Put MIDI Files

```text
wwm-overlay/
├── wwm-overlay.exe
├── album/              <- Put your .mid files here!
│   ├── song1.mid
│   ├── song2.mid
│   └── song3.mid
└── ...
```

## 🧪 Testing

- `.\scripts\dev.cmd bun run test` - run the Vitest suite once (global jest-dom helpers are preloaded via src/setupTests.js).
- `.\scripts\dev.cmd bun run test:watch` - keep Vitest in watch mode while you edit.
- `.\scripts\dev.cmd bun run test:coverage` - emit coverage reports (text + lcov.info) via the built-in v8 provider; the report now covers every JavaScript/TypeScript/Svelte file under `src/` and `src-tauri/` (excluding folders like `node_modules` and the stores we intentionally skip) and writes results under coverage/.
- `.\scripts\dev.cmd bun run coverage:check` - parse coverage/lcov.info and emit a warning if the line coverage for `src/lib/utils/**/*.js` and `src/lib/version.js` stays below 80% so the gate stays focused on the shared helper logic.
- `.\scripts\dev.cmd bun run album:audit` - scan the release album for exact and normalized duplicate MIDI files and validate tracked manifest metadata.
- `.\scripts\dev.cmd bun run shortcut:verify` - verify the desktop shortcut points at the latest release executable.

The coverage workflow (.github/workflows/coverage.yml) runs `bun run test:coverage`, `bun run coverage:check`, and `bun run album:audit` on pushes to main and on pull requests so reviewers get soft warnings whenever coverage dips below the project-wide 80% target.

## Windows 11 Performance Checklist

- Keep Windows Update and optional driver updates current before diagnosing game or overlay stutter.
- Keep Where Winds Meet on an SSD with enough free space for large updates.
- Use Windows graphics settings for windowed-game optimizations when playing in borderless/windowed mode.
- Reduce startup/background apps before long play sessions.
- Use `Diagnostics\run-windows.ps1` for a read-only snapshot of storage, startup commands, power mode, free space, and relevant Windows event evidence.
